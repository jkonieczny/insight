Insight

Provides a tool that collates information from multiple deployed web application nodes into a single
html based view.

Insight relies on web applications exposing their configuration properties as a resource representation based
on the following microformat:

<dl class="property">
    <dt class="name">{property.name}</dt>
    <dd class="value">{property.value}</dd>
</dl>
